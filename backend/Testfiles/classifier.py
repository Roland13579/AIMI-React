Item classifier

Takes in the name + description of an item and assign it a category (industry)

so an item like "STMr34 Chip : A chip designed by STM" would be assigned into the semiconductors industry category

Right now im using a test products.csv file for testing. It includes two columns, item name and its correct category for training.

The Categories are : 

Use this info to gauge what this component does. We need to get the categories for each item and have as a new column in the original sales by week dataframe we made in weekly_sales_aggregator.py
